The task board display's tasks in columns representing their progress states (Not Yet Started, In Progress, Completed), and tasks are color-coded based on their deadlines. Users can add, edit, and delete tasks, and the task states persist across page refreshes using localStorage.

2. Add a new task by clicking the “Add Task” button and filling in the task details.
3. Tasks will display in the “To Do” column.
4. Drag tasks between columns to update their progress state.
